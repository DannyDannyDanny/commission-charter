For each attendant, C, consider the nodes:
* Pre-commission location (i.e. work), L_pre
* Comission location, L_commission (is variable)
* Post-commission location (i.e. home) L_post

Should be weighted by attendees attendance.

Distance between nodes is decided by distance (eventually, use Rejseplanen API).
The distance for each attendants... something like:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{N} D_{L_{pre_{i}} \rightarrow L_{commission}} +  D_{L_{comission} \rightarrow L_{post_{i}}}$$

Where $D_{a \rightarrow b}$ is distance from $a$ $b$.
